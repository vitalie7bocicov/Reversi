This project is an implementation of Reversi using the client-server architecture, with communication handled through TCP/IP. The game is developed in C and C++, incorporating various technologies to enhance the gaming experience.</p><p><img src="imgs/reversi.png?raw=true" alt="Reversi Board"></p><h2>Technologies Used</h2><p>The Reversi game project utilizes the following technologies:</p><ul><li>SQLite: Used to store and manage a ranking of the top N best players.</li><li>Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML): Employed for the user interface, providing graphics and interactive elements.</li><li>POSIX Threads (pthreads): Enables concurrent execution by creating a separate thread for each game, allowing multiple games to run in parallel.</li></ul><h2>Features</h2><p>The Reversi game project includes the following features:</p><ul><li>Client-Server Architecture: The game employs a client-server model, with communication handled over TCP/IP. This allows multiple clients to connect to the server and play against each other.</li><li>Play Against the Computer: If a player leaves the game, the remaining player has the option to continue playing against the computer. The computer player utilizes the minimax algorithm to determine the best move, providing a challenging opponent.</li><li>Leaderboard: After winning a game, players have the opportunity to save their name for the leaderboard. This adds a competitive element to the game, allowing players to track their progress and compare their performance against others.</li></ul><p><img src="imgs/computer.png?raw=true" alt="Option to play with the computer"></p><p><img src="imgs/leaderboard.png?raw=true" alt="Leaderboard"></p><p>For more detailed information, please refer to the project's documentation.</p><p>Feel free to explore and enjoy the Reversi game!
